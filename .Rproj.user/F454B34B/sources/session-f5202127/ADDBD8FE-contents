**Project Goals** <br /><br />
	This project uses a convergent mixed methods approach to identify significant aspects of social networks associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) self-management among Black/African American men by recruiting a nationally representative sample of 1,200 Black/African American males with T2D using Qualtrics research panels and a cohort of 65 Black/African American males from the national sample will be asked to participate in longitudinal qualitative interviewing regarding their social networks with two follow-ups at six months and one year. The results of this proposed study are expected to have a significant positive impact by providing tangible social intervention points that can be used to design effective interventions focusing on the relationship between social support networks and T2D management among Black/African American males.
