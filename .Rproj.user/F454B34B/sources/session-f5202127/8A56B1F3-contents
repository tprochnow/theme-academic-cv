This project is funded by the Baylor University Research Committee in collaboration with two Boys & Girls Clubs to examine the role of summer care on friendship and physical activity over a summer. This longitudinal study aims to add to the literature surrounding the decrease in activity over summer and elaborate on the role friends play in physical activity behavior. The role of sex and gender will also be examined in the differences in friend groups and activity may change as children move through adolescence.
