**Project Goals** <br /><br />
	The goal of this project is to understand Black/African American expert discussion around historical context and consequences of inequities that have discouraged physical activity among Black/African American individuals/communities (e.g., limited access to routes and/or destinations, feeling unsafe in their neighborhoods, etc.). <br /><br />
	The contractor will conduct an environmental scan of what Black/African American experts are saying related to activity friendly routes to everyday destinations strategies (routes to destinations), including policy, system, and environmental changes that can promote or discourage equitable and inclusive access to physical activity for Black/African American communities.
