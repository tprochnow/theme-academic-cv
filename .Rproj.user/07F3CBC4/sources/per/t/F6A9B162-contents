## Survey Design
- Network Generator – question or prompt which generates a list of alters related to a specific relationship or connection
  - Connect, interact, communicate, influence
- Name interpreters – questions designed to collect information regarding the alters listed above
  - Gender, age, frequency of contact, perception of activity/support
- Alter interrelater – questions designed to determine connections between alters
  - Does Tom know Bob?
  - Details structural holes 

## Egocentric
- Can use all three – Generator, Interpreter, Interrelater
- Names are not important in this setting 
- Collect information on alters from the ego perception
- Alter Limits – Some surveys have limited the number of alters an ego can nominate

[Egocentric Example](/courses/intro/egosample.pdf)

## Whole Network
- May only use name generator as all other elements are reported by the others in the network
- Roster based -  supplies a roster of names from the bounded network
  - Can be helpful to match names
  - May be difficult with large networks or not possible if you do not have all of the names
- Free recall - the ego supplies names from memory
  - Larger networks or networks in which you do not know all members
  - May be difficult to match names (Bob/Robert) 
- Both come with a level of bias – roster may lead to over reporting, free recall may lead to under reporting

[Whole Network Example](/courses/intro/wholenetsample.pdf)

## Survey Administration
- Researcher administered – industry standard
- Online surveys – can be difficult based on software
- Nomination limit concerns
- Roster / recall concerns

## Software Available (collection)
- [EgoWeb2.0](https://www.qualintitative.com/egoweb/)
- [PARTNER](https://visiblenetworklabs.com/our-product-solutions/)
- [Network Canvas](https://www.networkcanvas.com/)
- [Enso (formerly OpenEddi)](https://iuni.iu.edu/projects/enso)
- [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) 

## Other types of collection
- Observational networks
  - Observational techniques similar to SOPARC, SOPLAY, SOFIT can be modified to track target individuals and the interactions between them and others
  - Multiple timepoints are needed to detail multiple connections
- Natural Networks
  - Networks already in place in which you would like to determine impact of their structure
  - Example: Parks or crossings connected by trails / paths
    - Nodes – parks and attributes of the park 
    - Ties / Edges – trails which connect them
    - May determine important trails to maintain or parks which are important midpoints in trail networks
- Two-Mode Networks
  - Nodes are not connected to each other but are connected through a second type of node (mode)
  - Example: people using a park – person -> park -> person 
    - This can then tell the parks of PA resources people may have “shared”  
- Cognitive Mapping
  - Type of whole network interviewing based on perception
  - Every member asked to map all connections between every person in the network
  - Perceptions of all individuals are overlapped and condensed to develop a final network 
  - Example: adolescents connections at after-school program 
- Public Records
  - Social media accounts – scraping data from accounts
  - Email records
  - Public announcements
  - Organization member lists
  
## Data Files
- Relational data: connects one node to another
  - Edgelist: easiest form – A-B, B-C, A-D
  - Matrix: all members are listed on X and Y axis, 1 is placed in each cell which a connection is present a 0 is placed if there is no connection
- Attribute table – file containing all ego information 
  - Demographics, outcome variables, etc.
