## Expectations

We expect all participants to treat eachother and the instructors with respect. This workshop is not just for the benefit of the participants but everyone which your research can impact. Please remember that everyone is trying to learn and improve, this includes the instructors. While we do not expect this to be an issue, we will ask you to leave if your behavior does not meet these expectations.
