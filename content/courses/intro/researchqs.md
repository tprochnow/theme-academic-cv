## Personal Network Activity

Participants will be led through an interactive method of collecting personal network data. This activity will help solidify the role of egocentric analysis. 

## Centrality Activity
- Secrets have been stolen from a drawer in your office
- There are 5 suspects (not in the room): Adam, Brandon, Erica, Jake, Lisa
- You can only speak to the people you work with (listed on handouts)
- Each round you can exchange one clue (any clue you have been given) with one person you work with (Dyadic exchange)
- Track clues on sheet
- Rounds will last 1 minute
- Denote when you think you have learned who stole the folder
