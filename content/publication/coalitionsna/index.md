 abstract = "**Purpose:** The health equity and prosperity of communities is closely linked to the effectiveness and success of local health coalitions. Social network analysis (SNA) is one mechanism to quantify and understand the factors leading to collaboration and effectiveness within these coalitions. This study aims to investigate network characteristics associated with perceived success and satisfaction in a health coalition and determine significant factors related to organizational collaborations.  <br /><br /> **Approach:** This study examined the Olympic Peninsula Healthy Community Coalition (OPHCC) which aims to prevent chronic disease in rural Clallam County, Washington. Representatives (n=21) from member organizations (n=18) were asked to report on organization characteristics, perceived satisfaction in coalition activities, perceived success toward coalition’s mission, and collaborations with other organizations in the coalition. Multilevel modeling used to analyze whether an organization’s position within the coalition network was associated with their perceived satisfaction and perceived success. Exponential random graph modeling was used to examine what factors may impact collaboration ties between coalition members. <br /> <br /> **Findings:** Organization representatives reported a total of 252 collaboration ties. In multilevel models, organization characteristics and network centrality scores accounted for between 61% and 68% of variance displayed in satisfaction scores and 45% to 61% of variance in perceived success scores. Exponential random graph modeling revealed activity level, for-profit status, and transitivity as significant factors in collaborative tie presence. <br /><br /> **Value:** Encouraging consistent active participation, a balance of organizational type, and projects which require more than two collaborators may provide an environment for collaborative ties between organizations."
