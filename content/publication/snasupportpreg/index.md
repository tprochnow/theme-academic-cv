 abstract = "Pregnancy is a unique time when physicians have more regular contact with women. Using this time to more fully understand the social influences at play can provide physicians an opportunity to leverage networks to improve health and wellbeing while stemming the exposure to health misinformation. Advocating for supportive social networks or exercise groups/programs can provide additional support and behavioral reinforcement which is needed for sustained behavior change. In this manner, fostering these networks is likely more beneficial to supporting healthy exercise behavior during pregnancy than education alone."
