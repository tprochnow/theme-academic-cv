 abstract = "System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) can provide accurate assessment of physical activity; however, the skills, time, and human resources necessary to collect/interpret SOPARC data can be challenging for community organizations. This article describes a more accessible adaptation of SOPARC using video recordings for community organizations to obtain physical activity feedback at Play Streets. Narrated panoramic video scans occurred every 30 minutes at each Play Street using an iPad. Videographers narrated: (1) sex, (2) age group (child, teen, adult, senior), and (3) activity level (sedentary, walking, vigorous) for everyone recorded. SOPARC video scans, in-person iSOPARC observations, and interviews were conducted with Play Streets implementors to determine validity and feasibility. Validity was examined using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). In-person and video scans showed near perfect agreement for sedentary individuals (CCC = .95) and substantial agreement for active individuals (CCC = .72). Overall, community partners felt that they “could see how [the scans] could be useful” and “help[ed] see a bit more clearly what’s happening.” The method described here is a more accessible systematic observation approach to measure physical activity for communities implementing Play Streets. Further, this method can be used without research training while still providing valuable activity feedback."
